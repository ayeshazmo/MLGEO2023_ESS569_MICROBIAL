    "The next steps for publication would be to define the hyperparameters more to lower the RMSE or MSE of each model. This could be done by prioritizing metabolites that are more powerful in determining the inorganic nitrogen concentrations as well as refining or normalizing the data to additional metadata beyond particulate carbon. This data could be of interest to a variety of journals, including ones such as Nature, which has a broad scope of interests, as well as journals with an emphasis on marine science, such as Frontiers in Marine Science.
